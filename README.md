# Hey everyone✌️
##  I'm Fidaa🤎 فداء  
### My family is originally from Syria, but I was born and raised in RI. URI has been my second home for the last 6 years since I completed my bachelors prior to   my current masters education here. I'm a M.S. candidate in the BES program working on a thesis under Dr. Jason Parent's guidance. My thesis is heavily based on GIS  which is great because I feel more comfortable learning to code for a software that I'm really familiar with. Excited yet anxious about this class, but looking forward to it all nevertheless. 

### Other than being GIS's biggest fan, I like to spend my time at the gym and enjoying nature🌄.

#### My thesis is about using GIS to monitor carbon in tidal marsh soils so my sweethearted friend took me to a beautiful tidal marsh in Sandwich, MA for my last birthday.
